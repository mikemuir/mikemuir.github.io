So I ended up getting Silver for an Imperial Stout I had brewed last year in the latest Hangar 24 Homebrew Competition (Hangar 24 Brewery).  This is the first competition I entered and was not expecting to get anything other than feedback on the beer, so i'm happy to have gotten it.

Homebrewing has turned into one of my favorite hobbies to do, and makes for a wonderfully lazy weekend day when I do so.  Its not exactly a lazy thing in of itself (lugging around 5+ gallons of liquid at a time), but its entertaining.

If you want to see what goes into the Imperial Stout I made, I posted the recipe on the BeerSmith Cloud for use: Imperium.
