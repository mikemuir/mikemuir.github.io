So, i'm the IT Operations Senior Manager for Acorns Grow Inc.  Historically, this had me randomly adding posts on various Apple geekery, techie posts, and beer, because its impossible for me to remember all the various things i've leared over the years.  Now its just to archive it for the future.  Maybe i'll decide to add more stuff in when I begin to feel like it...


Im also in the process of replacing my website (moving from an old Squarespace to Github.io).
This is using the custom theme Centrarium for [Jekyll][jekyll], made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog.  Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/). And you can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
